# ‚ô†Ô∏è Blackjack Game (TypeScript + Express)

A lightweight, server-side Blackjack game API built with **TypeScript** and **Express**. Designed for experimentation, learning, and extension, the backend handles game state, deck logic, player turns, and actions like hitting or standing ‚Äî all exposed via a simple RESTful interface.

## ‚ú® Features

- ‚ô†Ô∏è Fully functional Blackjack rules
- üë§ Player vs Dealer logic
- üß† Turn-based game flow
- üîÑ Stateless JSON API
- üß™ Easy to test and expand
- üì¶ Clean project structure (services, models, routes)
- ‚úçÔ∏è Written entirely in **TypeScript**

### üöß Planned Feature

- **Betting system**: In future versions, players will be able to place bets and manage balances.

## ‚ô†Ô∏è Blackjack Rules

The game follows the basic rules of Blackjack:

- **Card Values**:
  - Number cards are worth their face value.
  - Face cards (Jack, Queen, King) are worth 10.
  - Aces are worth either 1 or 11, depending on which is more advantageous.
  
- **Gameplay**:
  - Players aim to get as close to 21 as possible without going over.
  - Players can choose to "hit" (take another card) or "stand" (stop their turn).
  - The dealer must hit until their total is at least 17.
  - Players win if their hand is closer to or equal to 21 than the dealer's without exceeding 21.
  - A hand that has 21 is refered to as `Blackjack`, or a win
  - If players have gone over 21 it is refered to as `Bust`, or a loss
  - If players have equal points, including 21 v 21, it is refered to as `Draw`
